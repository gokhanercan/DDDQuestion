# DDDQuestion
Questioning Domain-Driven Concepts, am I doing right? Help me :)

First of all:
We assume
- Anemic Domain Model is an Anti-Pattern
- Service Locator is an Anti-Pattern (in most cases)

I am trying to en-Rich Domain Model.

I am not happy with Vacation models Approve method.
Can you help me ?
